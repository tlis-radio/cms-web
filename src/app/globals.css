I'm sorry but I'm really not sure why:
** .swiper-slide-prev
** .swiper-slide-next
** .swiper-slide:not(.swiper-slide-visible)
** .swiper-slide:is(.swiper-slide-visible)
are written like this, but if i delete something from it, it breaks

* ! Problem 1: The 3rd slide from the beginning and the end don't follow the opacity transition 0.5 from 0 to 1 (invisible to visible).
* ! They jump right from 0 to 1
* ! 26.6.2024 11:10 - It's an Opera and Edge Problem
